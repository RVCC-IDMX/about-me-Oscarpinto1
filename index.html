    <h2>Welcome to fitness guru</h2>
    <p>
        You have made it past the transition portal. In accepting this new life, you must make pact, not to me , not to
        the fitness guru life, but to yours truly ,yourself.
        This journey is not going to be linear nor simple. You will face pain, upsets, defeats, and every emotion or
        feeling you hate because it makes you so damn uncomftorable.


    </p>

    <h2>The Pact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Promise to enter every workout with a positive and abundant mindset
        </li>
        <li>
            Promise to prepare both mentally and physically before very session
        </li>
        <li>
            Promise to keep the same intesnity from the very begining of the session to the end
        </li>
        <li>
            Promise to give absolutley every ounce of sweat and blood you physcially can into this lift, this is going
            to take grit.
        <li>
            Not every day is going to be the same, you can be tired, in pain, hungry, whatever it may be. But if you
            dotn give it your absolute all and when you ask yourself the question of did I win today and that gut
            feeling arises, you will go home a loser. Promise yourself you will go home a winner.
        </li>
        </li>
        <h2>
            Adopt the Tom Platz mentality
        </h2>
        <p>
            When you promise yourself something, make a commitment, you can't give up. Because, when you're in the gym,
            you have to fulfill the promise you made to yourself. The people who can self motivate - in any field - are
            usually the ones who win. Regardless of talent. Tom Platz

            If you are not willing to commit, the portal is opened again. Return to normal life and conform.
